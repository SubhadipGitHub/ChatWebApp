Chat Application
Vision
The Chat Application is designed to provide a secure, real-time messaging platform using modern technologies. The app features end-to-end encryption for messages, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read them. The project leverages FastAPI for the back end, React for the front end, and MongoDB for storage. This setup offers a scalable, responsive, and interactive user experience.

Implementation
Back-End
Framework: FastAPI
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access control
Encryption: Messages are encrypted using RSA and decrypted using the private key.
Key Endpoints:

POST /register: Register a new user with public and private keys.
POST /token: Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens.
POST /send_message: Send an encrypted message to a receiver.
GET /get_messages/{user_id}: Retrieve and decrypt messages for a specific user.
WebSocket /ws/{user_id}: Real-time communication endpoint for chat.
Front-End
Framework: React
Styling: Bootstrap 5.3
Features:

Real-time message updates using WebSocket.
Responsive design with Bootstrap for a seamless user experience.
JWT-based authentication to secure the application.
Deployment/Run Steps
Back-End
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi uvicorn pymongo cryptography pyjwt
Start FastAPI Server:

Run the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn app:app --reload
The server will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

Front-End
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the chat-app directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app chat-app
cd chat-app
npm install axios socket.io-client
Start React Development Server:

Run the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The front end will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Configuration
Update API Endpoints:

Ensure that the React application’s baseURL in src/App.js matches the URL where your FastAPI server is running.

Secrets Management:

Update SECRET_KEY in app.py with a secure key of your choice.
Make sure to securely manage and store your RSA keys and JWT secret.
Testing
Unit Tests: Write and run tests to verify the functionality of your FastAPI endpoints and React components.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between the front end and back end to ensure proper communication and data handling.
